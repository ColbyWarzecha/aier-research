initial_prompt: |
  You are an expert in financial analysis and cryptocurrency markets. I have conducted a regression analysis to study the impact of specific events in Argentina on the BTCUSDT and USDCHF currency pairs. The events of interest are:
  1. Javier Milei's primary election victory on August 13, 2023
  2. Javier Milei's general election victory on October 22, 2023
  3. The finance minister's tweet about Bitcoin approval on December 21, 2023
  The analysis used a time window of 2 days before and after each event, and did not use log returns. The currency pairs examined were BTCUSDT (Bitcoin to US Dollar) and USDCHF (US Dollar to Swiss Franc).

  Based on the regression results provided below, please interpret the findings, focusing on:
  1. The significance of each event's impact on the BTCUSDT and USDCHF pairs
  2. Any differences in how these currency pairs reacted to the events
  3. Potential explanations for the observed effects, considering the political and economic context in Argentina
  4. The implications of these findings for understanding Bitcoin's role as a potential safe haven or hedge in the context of political and economic uncertainty in Argentina
